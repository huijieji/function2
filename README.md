// This is a Healing Space for the Heartbroken website I built to help people cope with breakups
// Core features: mood journaling, therapeutic music, and inspirational quotes
// This project is part of my ongoing exploration of JavaScript and emotional web design. 
// The idea is to help people going through breakups express their feelings and find comfort in quotes and get music suggestions that match their mood.
